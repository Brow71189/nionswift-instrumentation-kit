Welcome to Nion Swift Instrumentation documentation!
====================================================
When using Nion Swift with a Nion STEM microscope, you can access the STEM instrument, control scanning, acquire data
from cameras, scans, video, and other detectors, and synchronize scans with cameras and other detectors. You can also
add custom cameras and other detectors, although that is not covered in this guide.

Getting Started

   * Begin by reading about the :ref:`stem-instrument`.
   * Next, read about performing :ref:`scan_control`.
   * Read about using the :ref:`using-cameras`.
   * Read about using :ref:`using-video`.
   * Finally, read about doing :ref:`advanced-acquisition`.
